<div><strong>4. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.</em></div>
<div>The App may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the App. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</div>
<div><strong>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></div>
<div>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 6 months.</div>
<div>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</div>
<div><strong>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&nbsp;We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></div>
<div>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.</div>

<div><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></div>
<div>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the App, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the App. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at bilibuddyapp@gmail.com.</div>
<div><strong>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></div>
<div>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-custom-class="link">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</div>

<div><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></div>
<div>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></div>
<div><strong><em>In Short:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</em></div>
<div>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</div>

<div><strong>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
